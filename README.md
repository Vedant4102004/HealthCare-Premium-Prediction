# HealthCare-Premium-Prediction
This project aims to develop an AI-driven health insurance premium prediction model to accurately assess risk and pricing for individuals based on health metrics, lifestyle, and demographic factors. The goal is to reduce extreme prediction errors while maintaining business-aligned accuracy.
### **Business Problem**
Insurance companies need to accurately predict a customer’s health risk to determine premium costs.

Inaccurate predictions can cause:

- Undercharging high-risk individuals, resulting in financial losses

- Overcharging low-risk individuals, leading to customer dissatisfaction and churn

The objective is to build a reliable model that provides accurate risk estimates and reduces extreme prediction errors, aligning with business goals.

###  **Objective**  
The goal of this project is to develop an accurate and reliable insurance risk prediction model that meets business requirements:  
 **Accuracy >95%** (R² ~0.95 or higher)  
 **Extreme error rate ≤10%**  

## **Feature Importance Analysis**  
#### **Most Important Features:**  
- **Insurance Plan** and **Age** have the strongest impact on predictions.  
- **Normalized Risk Score** and **BMI Category (Obesity)** also play significant roles.  

#### **Moderately Important Features:**  
- **Smoking Status (Regular, Occasional)** and **Employment Status (Self-Employed)** contribute but with smaller coefficients.  

#### **Least Important Features:**  
- **Marital Status (Unmarried), Number of Dependants, and Income Level** have minimal influence.

## **Extreme Error Analysis & Model Segmentation Strategy**  
#### **Issue Identified:**  
- **Initial extreme error rate:** **30%** (far exceeding the acceptable threshold).  
- **Young Age Group (≤25) Without Genetic Factors:** **Extreme error rate: 73%** – a major performance issue.  
- **Young Age Group (≤25) With Genetic Factors:** **Extreme error rate: 2%** – significant improvement.  
- **Older Age Group (>25):** **Extreme error rate: 0.3%** – acceptable performance.  

#### **Solution Approach: Segmentation-Based Modeling**  
- **Age Group >25 ("Rest")** – A dedicated model that meets business requirements.  
- **Age Group ≤25 ("Young") Without Genetic Factors** – Poor accuracy; requires a better approach.  
- **Age Group ≤25 ("Young") With Genetic Factors** – Introduced genetic factor-based features, improving performance significantly.

## **Model Performance Comparison**  

### **Age Group: >25 ("Rest")**  

| Model                         | R² Score (Train/Test) | Extreme Errors (%) |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|
| Linear & Ridge Regression      | 0.953                 | -                  |
| XGBoost (Before Tuning)        | 0.994                 | -                  |
| XGBoost (After Tuning)         | 0.997                 | 0.3%               |

**XGBoost significantly outperformed Linear & Ridge Regression.**  
**Hyperparameter tuning improved accuracy to 99.7%.**  
**Extreme errors reduced to 0.3%, meeting business requirements.**

### **Age Group: ≤25 ("Young") Without Genetic Factors**  

| Model                         | R² Score (Train/Test) | Extreme Errors (%) |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|
| Linear & Ridge Regression      | 0.602                 | -                  |
| XGBoost (Before Tuning)        | 0.603                 | -                  |
| XGBoost (After Tuning)         | 0.599                 | 73%                |

 **Extreme errors were too high (73%), failing business requirements.**  
 **R² was only ~60%, indicating poor model fit.**  
 **This approach was not viable, requiring additional features.**

### **Age Group: ≤25 ("Young") With Genetic Factors**  

| Model                         | R² Score (Train/Test) | Extreme Errors (%) |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|
| Linear & Ridge Regression      | 0.988                 | -                  |
| XGBoost (Before Tuning)        | 0.987                 | -                  |
| XGBoost (After Tuning)         | 0.987                 | 2%                 |

 **Introducing genetic factor-based features significantly improved model accuracy.**  
 **Extreme errors reduced from 73% to 2%, now within the acceptable range.**  
**XGBoost performed best with fine-tuning, achieving ~98.7% accuracy.**

### **Conclusion**

The insurance risk prediction model was developed using Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and XGBoost, with a focus on meeting business requirements of >95% accuracy and <10% extreme errors.

### **Key Findings:**

- Feature Importance: Age and Insurance Plan had the most significant impact on predictions.

### **Segmentation Approach Improved Accuracy:**

- Older Age Group (>25): XGBoost (Tuned) performed exceptionally well with 99.7% accuracy and only 0.3% extreme errors.

- Young Age Group (≤25) Without Genetic Factors: The model struggled, achieving only 60% accuracy with 73% extreme errors, making it unsuitable.

- Young Age Group (≤25) With Genetic Factors: Accuracy improved to 98.7% with 2% extreme errors, making it an effective solution.

### **Final Decision:**

**A two-model segmentation approach is the best solution:**

- Use the XGBoost model (After Tuning) separately for age groups to ensure high accuracy and minimal errors.

- For young individuals (≤25), incorporate genetic factors to improve predictions.

- This strategy ensures the model meets business expectations, reducing risk while maintaining predictive accuracy.
